    <p>A very filling, low-carb lasagna that uses cabbage leaves in place of lasagna noodles. We find it every bit as good if not better than lasagna with pasta.</p>

        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onoin, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoom minced garlic</li>
        <li>4 ounces mushroom pieces</li>
    </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add carrots and mushrooms. Add tomatoes and break up using a fork. Add basil, sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, thyme, and nutmeg. Reduce heat and simmer meat sauce for 30 minutes.</li>
            </ul>

        Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Immerse cabbage in the boiling water and carefully break off leaves. Cook until leaves are limp, about 3 minutes. Drain.
